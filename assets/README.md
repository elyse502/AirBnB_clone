# AirBnB clone
Alx-HolbertonBnB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.

The project currently only implements the back-end console.

# Concepts
_For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:_
* [Python packages](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/66)
* [AirBnB clone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/74)

# 1. Python packages
Read: [Packages](https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/modules.html#packages)

A Python file can be a **module** but when this file is in a folder, we call this folder a package.

File organization is really important in a big project. This means for Python: packages everywhere.

## Compare with C
(file organization, not prototype vs code etc.)

In C: `#include "abs.h"`

In Python:
```
import abs
abs.my_abs(89)
```
or
```
from abs import my_abs
my_abs(89)
```
In C: #include "my_math/abs.h"

In Python:
```
from my_math.abs import my_abs
my_abs(89)
```
or
```
import my_math.abs
my_math.abs.my_abs(89)
```

## Dotted module names == Path
Let’s take this example of file organization:
```
my_script.py
my_math/
    abs.py
```
How can I use my function `my_abs(a)` from the file `abs.py` in `my_script.py`?
* `import my_math/abs.py` => NO
* `import my_math/abs` => NO
* `import my_math.abs.py` => NO
* `import my_math.abs` => YES but you will use your function like that: `my_math.abs.my_abs(89)` => not friendly
* `from my_math.abs import my_abs` => YES YES YES! now you can use your function like that: `my_abs(89)`

Wait, does this really work?

NO! something is missing: the magic file `__init__.py`

Indeed, each folder must contain this file to be considered a package.

This file should be empty except if you want to import all the content of modules by using *.

More complicated?
```
my_script.py
my_math/
    __init__.py
    abs.py
    functions/
        __init__.py
        add.py
```
How can I use my function `my_add(a, b)` from the file `add.py` in `my_script.py`?

`from my_math.functions.add import my_add`

Easy right?

**`import *` is dangerous**

Using `import *` is still considered bad practice in production code. In that case, `__init__.py` shouldn’t be empty but must contain the list of modules to load:
```
my_script.py
my_math/
    __init__.py
    abs.py
    functions/
        __init__.py
        add.py
        sub.py
        mul.py
        div.py
```
```
$ cat my_script.py
from my_math.functions import *
print(add.my_add(1, 3))
print(mul.my_mul(4, 2))
print(div.my_div(10, 2))

$ cat my_math/__init__.py  # empty file
$ cat my_math/functions/__init__.py
__all__ = ["add", "mul"]

$ python3 my_script.py
3
8
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "my_script.py", line 4, in <module>
    print(div.my_div(10, 2))
NameError: name 'div' is not defined
$
```
## Relative versus Absolute import
In this example:
```
my_script.py
my_math/
    __init__.py
    abs.py
    positive.py
```
`positive.py` contains one function `def is_positive(n)` and this function uses `my_abs(n)`. How it’s possible?

By importing: `from my_math.abs import my_abs` or `from abs import my_abs`

What the difference?
* `from abs import my_abs` is using a relative path between your file who imports and the module to import
* `from my_math.abs import my_abs` is using an absolute path between the file you execute and the module to import
```
$ cat my_script.py
from my_math.positive import is_positive
print(is_positive(89))
print(is_positive(-89))
print(is_positive(333))

$ python3 my_script.py
True
False
True
$
```
Now, let’s execute a file in `my_math`:
```
$ cd my_math ; cat test_positive.py
from positive import is_positive
print(is_positive(89))
print(is_positive(-89))
print(is_positive(333))

$ cat positive.py
from my_math.abs import my_abs

def is_positive(n):
    return my_abs(n) == n

$ python3 test_positive.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test_positive.py", line 1, in <module>
    from positive import is_positive
  File "/vagrant/my_math/positive.py", line 1, in <module>
    from my_math.abs import my_abs
ImportError: No module named 'my_math'
$
```
Ahh! If you are using an absolute path, you can’t execute this module from another point as the “root” of your project.

Let’s change to relative path:
```
$ cd my_math ; cat test_positive.py
from positive import is_positive
print(is_positive(89))
print(is_positive(-89))
print(is_positive(333))

$ cat positive.py
from abs import my_abs

def is_positive(n):
    return my_abs(n) == n

$ python3 test_positive.py
True
False
True
$
```
# 2. AirBnB clone
I know you were waiting for it: it’s here!

The AirBnB clone project starts now until… the end of the first year. The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the [AirBnB website](https://www.airbnb.com/).

You won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:
* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## Final product

![da2584da58f1d99a72f0a4d8d22c1e485468f941](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/1841b787-c8af-49b4-9c5e-dab0a5633846)

## Concepts to learn
* [Unittest](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/unittest.html#module-unittest) - and please work all together on tests cases
* **Python packages** concept page
* Serialization/Deserialization
* `*args, **kwargs`
* `datetime`
* More coming soon!

## Steps
You won’t build this application all at once, but step by step.

Each step will link to a concept:

## The console
* create your data model
* manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
* store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine

## Web static
* learn HTML/CSS
* create the HTML of your application
* create template of each object

![87c01524ada6080f40fc](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/704ad78d-053c-4c30-bedc-3d87b19ebc69)

## MySQL storage
* replace the file storage by a Database storage
* map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.

![5284383714459fa68841](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/f492838c-4d2a-4a75-8324-cc903634c361)

## Web framework - templating
* create your first web server in Python
* make your static HTML file dynamic by using objects stored in a file or database

![cb778ec8a13acecb53ef](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/e801f00d-ced0-42ce-9bfc-acd1c2273f3e)

## RESTful API
* expose all your objects stored via a JSON web interface
* manipulate your objects via a RESTful API

![06fccc41df40ab8f9d49](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/d0515e05-f4b0-44a7-bbbc-f7ad7ecc159f)

## Web dynamic
* learn JQuery
* load objects from the client side by using your own RESTful API

![d2d06462824fab5846f3](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/50a350bb-2492-4701-a198-ef284721d971)

## Files and Directories
* `models` directory will contain all classes used for the entire project. A class, called “model” in a OOP project is the representation of an object/instance.
* `tests` directory will contain all unit tests.
* `console.py` file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
* `models/base_model.py` file is the base class of all our models. It contains common elements:
    * attributes: `id`, `created_at` and `updated_at`
    * methods: `save()` and `to_json()`
* `models/engine` directory will contain all storage classes (using the same prototype). For the moment you will have only one: `file_storage.py`.

## Storage
Persistency is really important for a web application. It means: every time your program is executed, it starts with all objects previously created from another execution. Without persistency, all the work done in a previous execution won’t be saved and will be gone.

In this project, you will manipulate 2 types of storage: file and database. For the moment, you will focus on file.

Why separate “storage management” from “model”? It’s to make your models modular and independent. With this architecture, you can easily replace your storage system without re-coding everything everywhere.

You will always use class attributes for any object. Why not instance attributes? For 3 reasons:
* Provide easy class description: everybody will be able to see quickly what a model should contain (which attributes, etc…)
* Provide default value of any attribute
* In the future, provide the same model behavior for file storage or database storage

## How can I store my instances?
That’s a good question. So let’s take a look at this code:
```
class Student():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

students = []
s = Student("John")
students.append(s)
```
Here, I’m creating a student and store it in a list. But after this program execution, my Student instance doesn’t exist anymore.
```
class Student():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

students = reload() # recreate the list of Student objects from a file
s = Student("John")
students.append(s)
save(students) # save all Student objects to a file
```
Nice!

But how it works?

First, let’s look at `save(students)`:
* Can I write each `Student` object to a file => NO, it will be the memory representation of the object. For another program execution, this memory representation can’t be reloaded.
* Can I write each `Student.name` to a file => YES, but imagine you have other attributes to describe `Student`? It would start to be become too complex.

The best solution is to convert this list of `Student` objects to a JSON representation.

Why JSON? Because it’s a standard representation of object. It allows us to share this data with other developers, be human readable, but mainly to be understood by another language/program.

Example:
* My Python program creates `Student` objects and saves them to a JSON file
* Another Javascript program can read this JSON file and manipulate its own `Student` class/representation

And the `reload()`? now you know the file is a JSON file representing all `Student` objects. So `reload()` has to read the file, parse the JSON string, and re-create `Student` objects based on this data-structure.

## File storage == JSON serialization
For this first step, you have to write in a file all your objects/instances created/updated in your command interpreter and restore them when you start it. You can’t store and restore a Python instance of a class as “Bytes”, the only way is to convert it to a serializable data structure:
* convert an instance to Python built in serializable data structure (list, dict, number and string) - for us it will be the method my_instance.to_json() to retrieve a dictionary
* convert this data structure to a string (JSON format, but it can be YAML, XML, CSV…) - for us it will be a my_string = JSON.dumps(my_dict)
* write this string to a file on disk

And the process of deserialization?

The same but in the other way:
* read a string from a file on disk
* convert this string to a data structure. This string is a JSON representation, so it’s easy to convert - for us it will be a my_dict = JSON.loads(my_string)
* convert this data structure to instance - for us it will be a my_instance = MyObject(my_dict)

**`*args, **kwargs`**

`How To Use them`

How do you pass arguments to a function?
```
def my_fct(param_1, param_2):
    ...

my_fct("Best", "School")
```
But with this function definition, you must call `my_fct` with 2 parameters, no more, no less.

Can it be dynamic? Yes you can:
```
def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
    ...

my_fct("Best", "School")
```
What? What’s `*args` and `**kwargs`?
* `*args` is a Tuple that contains all arguments
* `*kwargs` is a dictionary that contains all arguments by key/value

A dictionary? But why?

So, to make it clear, `*args` is the list of anonymous arguments, no name, just an order. `**kwargs` is the dictionary with all named arguments.

Examples:
```
def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
    print("{} - {}".format(args, kwargs))

my_fct() # () - {}
my_fct("Best") # ('Best',) - {}
my_fct("Best", 89) # ('Best', 89) - {}
my_fct(name="Best") # () - {'name': 'Best'}
my_fct(name="Best", number=89) # () - {'name': 'Best', 'number': 89}
my_fct("School", 12, name="Best", number=89) # ('School', 12) - {'name': 'Best', 'number': 89}
```
Perfect? Of course you can mix both, but the order should be first all anonymous arguments, and after named arguments.

Last example:
```
def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
    print("{} - {}".format(args, kwargs))

a_dict = { 'name': "Best", 'age': 89 }

my_fct(a_dict) # ({'age': 89, 'name': 'Best'},) - {}
my_fct(*a_dict) # ('age', 'name') - {}
my_fct(**a_dict) # () - {'age': 89, 'name': 'Best'}
```
You can play with these 2 arguments to clearly understand where and how your variables are stored.

**`datetime`**

`datetime` is a Python module to manipulate date, time etc…

In this example, you create an instance of `datetime` with the current date and time:
```
from datetime import datetime

date_now = datetime.now()
print(type(date_now)) # <class 'datetime.datetime'>
print(date_now) # 2017-06-08 20:42:42.170922
```
`date_now` is an object, so you can manipulate it:
```
from datetime import timedelta

date_tomorrow = date_now + timedelta(days=1)
print(date_tomorrow) # 2017-06-09 20:42:42.170922
```
… you can also store it:
```
a_dict = { 'my_date': date_now }
print(type(a_dict['my_date'])) # <class 'datetime.datetime'>
print(a_dict) # {'my_date': datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 8, 20, 42, 42, 170922)}
```
What? What’s this format when a `datetime` instance is in a datastructure??? It’s unreadable.

How to make it readable: [`strftime`](https://strftime.org/)
```
print(date_now.strftime("%A")) # Thursday
print(date_now.strftime("%A %d %B %Y at %H:%M:%S")) # Thursday 08 June 2017 at 20:42:42
```

# Background Context
### Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
Before starting, please read the **AirBnB** concept page.

#### First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:
* put in place a parent class (called `BaseModel`) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
* create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* create all classes used for AirBnB (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`…) that inherit from `BaseModel`
* create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

## What’s a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

# Python Unit Tests
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
* You have to use the [unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/unittest.html#module-unittest)
* All your test files should be python files (extension: `.py`)
* All your test files and folders should start by `test_`
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
* e.g., For `models/base_model.py`, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
* e.g., For `models/user.py`, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_user.py`
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
* You can also test file by file by using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
* All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

# More Info
## Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)
```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```
All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: `$ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash`
